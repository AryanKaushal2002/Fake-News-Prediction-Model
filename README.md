# Fake News Prediction Model
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that implements a machine learning model for predicting fake news. The model is built using logistic regression and Python.

## Dataset
- The model is trained on the [Fake News competition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news).
- The dataset consists of various textual features and labels indicating whether the news is fake or not.

## Model
- The model is based on a supervised learning algorithm called logistic regression.
- It uses a linear classifier to predict the probability of a news article being fake or not based on its features.

## Usage
- Download the [Fake News competition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news).
- Place the dataset file in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file in this repository.
- Run the notebook to train the model and make predictions on new data.

## Requirements
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- scikit-learn (version 0.24 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- The results can be viewed and analyzed within the Jupyter Notebook.
